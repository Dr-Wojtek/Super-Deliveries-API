## Super-Deliveries
Super Deliveries is a program using the A* search algorithm, a dynamic knapsack solution and custom logic to find the shortest possible route for the highest valuable combination of orders.

The orders and the addresses used to calculate the route are loaded from an SQLite database. 15 different orders and 40 addresses are included.
The database should reside in folder "db" within CWD.
